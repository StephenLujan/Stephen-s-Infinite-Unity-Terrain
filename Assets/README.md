# Stephen s Infinite Unity Terrain

Terrain generator and manager creating infinite terrain in the Unity game engine. This asset will utilitize Unity's built-in Terrain objects to support all features provided by Unity for terrain. The TerrainManager will request Unity Terrain "tiles" from the TerrainGenerator within a radius of the player, loading new tiles and unloading old tiles as the player moves. Unity Terrain are created procedurally, with heightmaps, texture splat maps, and detail maps, by the TerrainGenerator, using multithreading and parallelism as much as possible, and places them on a queue for the TerrainManager to receive and utilize. The terrain generator can utilize noise from either the Unity engine or from [Jordan Peck's FastNoise] (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/fastnoise-70706). The TerrainManager, TerrainGenerator, and various Noise implentations all have many customizable settings controllable through custom Unity editors.  Currently a single unactive (not visible) unity terrain is used as a template for terrain tiles to control aspects such as terrain tile width, length, hieght, terrain layers, detail prototypes, tree prototypes, etc.
